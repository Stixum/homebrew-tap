  # Deliberately does NOT remove the statusLine key from ~/.claude/settings.json.
  # A cask cannot safely edit a user's config file, and a leftover key pointing
  # at a deleted binary merely prints "command not found" in the status line —
  # annoying, but it does not break Claude Code. Removing it wrongly would.
